# Part of Calculation Note for Abundance Evolution of Scalar Boson

_[FytcNote-2024-1-part] Version 1.0.1 published on June 23, 2024_

This is the part of calculation note for problem #4 in Prof. Dr. Xu Xun-Jie's Coffee Medal, which is available at https://xunjiexu.github.io/files/questions-v2.pdf.
In this problem, a 100 MeV hypothetical scalar boson only coupled to the electron is considered, where the Yukawa coupling is given by $y = 10^{-12}$.
The initial abundance of the scalar boson in the early universe is zero at a sufficiently high temperature.
In this part note, I will only show a the calculations for the collision term and some useful integrals.
